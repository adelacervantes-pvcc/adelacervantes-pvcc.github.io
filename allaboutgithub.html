		<td>What is a version control system?</td>
		<td>A version control system (VCS) is a system that records 
			changes to a file or set of files over time so that you 
			can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple 
			people to work on a project simultaneously, providing 
			a mechanism to track and merge changes made by different 
		    individuals. Version control is essential in collaborative 
			software development and is widely used in managing the 
			 source code of computer programs.

		<td>What is Git?</td>
		<td>Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that 
			is widely used for tracking changes in source code during 
			software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in
		    2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel, and it
			has since become one of the most popular version control 
			systems for software development projects of all sizes.</td>
	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>What is GitHub?</td>
		<td> GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for 
			software development and version control using Git. It 
			serves as a central repository for source code, enabling 
			collaboration among developers on projects of all sizes. 
			GitHub offers a range of features that facilitate project 
			management, collaboration, and community engagement.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>What is the difference between git and GitHub?</td>
		<td> Git is the version control system itself, a tool 
			that developers use locally to manage source code 
			changes. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based 
			platform that provides a remote repository hosting 
			service with additional collaboration and project 
			management features built on top of Git. While Git 
			can be used independently of GitHub, GitHub leverages 
			Git for version control and enhances it with a collaborative 
			and web-based environment.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Who started Github annd how was it started?</td>
		<td>GitHub was founded by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, 
			and PJ Hyett, officially launching in April 2008. 
			The platform emerged from their experiences using the Git 
			version control system, aiming to create a more user-friendly 
			and collaborative environment for developers. GitHub quickly 
			gained popularity due to its intuitive interface and social 
			coding features, providing a central hub for hosting and 
			collaborating on Git repositories. Over the years, it has 
			become a pivotal platform in open-source development, hosting 
			millions of projects and playing a significant role in changing 
			the landscape of collaborative software development.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>What company owns it now?</td>
		<td> Microsoft owns GitHub. Microsoft acquired GitHub in a 
			deal that was announced in June 2018 and completed later 
			that year. The acquisition was seen as a strategic move 
			by Microsoft to strengthen its position in the developer 
			community and the broader software development ecosystem.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>What is Octocat?</td>
		<td>Octocat is the mascot of GitHub. It's a cute and 
            friendly cat with a humanoid face and a notable 
            octopus-like shape with eight tentacles. The Octocat 
            is often associated with GitHub's branding and is used 
            to represent the platform in various contexts.</td>
