                        <td style="padding: 5px;"> An operating system is software that serves as a bridge
                            between computer hardware and users. It manages and coordinates various aspects
                            of a computer system, including processor, memory, files, devices, security, and
                            user interface. Key functions include task scheduling, memory allocation, file
                            management, device control, security enforcement, and providing a user interface.
                            Popular examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.</td>

                        <td style="padding: 5px;"> A system for organizing and managing a sequence of tasks or
                            jobs that need to be processed by a computer. Jobs are submitted to the queue,
                            processed in the order they are received, and typically involve batch processing
                            without direct user interaction. The operating system allocates resources to each
                            job as it moves through the queue, and administrators can monitor and control the
                            execution of jobs. Job queues are common in environments where efficient resource
                            utilization is important.</td>

                        <td style="padding: 5px;"> Stands for "First In, First Out," is a principle used in organizing
                            data structures like queues. In a FIFO queue, the first element added is the first one
                            to be removed. This principle is akin to waiting in line, where the person who arrives
                            first is served first. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and is applied in
                            various algorithms and data structures, ensuring that items are processed in the order they arrive.</td>
